Look at include/coding_style/example_type.h

This file contains a bunch of formatting examples for a wide range of situations. I implemented everything in the .h for simplicity; under
normal conditions, non-template function implementations should go in a source file (here, src/example_type.cpp). In the case of template
functions or a template class, a "details" folder containing "_impl.h" files should be created, and the implementations of template functions
should be placed within (here, include/coding_styles/details/example_type_impl.h). However, for this assessment, template functions may be
implemented in-place as with this project.

Any source files for executables should go in an "exe" folder.

Compiled executables should be placed in "bin", and compiled static or shared libraries should be placed in "lib".
