This project contains a set of simple ROS nodes
 - Read through the source code and describe, at a high level, what each node is doing, and how any communications influence other nodes
 - List the type and purpose of any parameters used by any of these nodes
 - For each connection (topic, service, or action) started or used by any of these nodes, list:
   - The full name
   - The type
   - The nodes directly involved
   - The relationship between the nodes involved with respect to the connection (ie client/server, broadcaster/receiver, etc)
 - Write down the command(s) you would use to run this system of nodes
 - Write down the command(s) you would use to set the target level for controller_node to "1"; assume the system is running
